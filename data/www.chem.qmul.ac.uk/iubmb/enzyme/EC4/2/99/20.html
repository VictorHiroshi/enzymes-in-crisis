In most anaerobes and all Gram-positive aerobes, menaquinone is the sole electron transporter in the respiratory chain and is essential for their survival. It had previously been thought that the reactions carried out by this enzyme and <a href="../../../EC2/2/1/9.html">EC 2.2.1.9</a>, 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic-acid synthase, were carried out by a single enzyme but this has since been disproved [2].<p><b>Links to other databases:</b> <a href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/enzyme.php?ecno=4.2.99.20" target="new">BRENDA</a>, <a href="http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/4.2.99.20" target="new">EXPASY</a>, <a href="http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ec:4.2.99.20" target="new">KEGG</a>, <a href="http://www.metacyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=EC-NUMBER&object=EC-4.2.99.20" target="new">Metacyc</a>,CAS registry number: 122007-88-9<p><b>References:</b><p>1.
